# Description:
This repository contains 5 mini-games that you can be run in the console (Ubuntu).

## Installation: 
1) `git clone https://github.com/SierraMoiseevna/frontend-project-44.git`
2) `make install`

## Game: "Parity check"
A random number is shown to the user.
The user enters the answer into the console: "yes" if the number is even,
or "no" if it is odd
Game start: make brain-even

## Game: "Calculator"
The user is shown a random mathematical
expression, for example 35 + 16. The user calculates and records
the correct answer is in  console.
Game Launch: make brain-calc
Demonstration of the work: 
<script async id="asciicast-636163" src="https://asciinema.org/a/636163 .js"></script>

## Game "Greatest Common Divisor" 
The user is shown two random numbers,
for example, 25 50. The user calculates and
enters the greatest common divisor of these numbers into the console.
Game Launch: make brain-gcd
Demonstration of the work: 
<script async id="asciicast-636232" src="https://asciinema.org/a/636232 .js"></script>

## Game "Arithmetic Progression"
shows the user a series of numbers forming an arithmetic
a progression, any of the numbers is replaced by two dots.
The user determines this number and writes the response to 
 console.
Game Launch: make brain-progression
Demonstration of the work: 
<script async id="asciicast-636250" src="https://asciinema.org/a/636250 .js"></script>


## Game "Is it a prime number?"
A random number is shown to the user. The user
answers "yes" if the number is prime, or "no" if
the number is not prime.
Game Launch: make brain-prime
